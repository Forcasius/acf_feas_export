# ACF FEAS export

*__Warning: This is throw-away code, that will be used one time only. Do not expect sophisticated error handling!__*

## Usage

Put the FEAS export files into the 'convert_feas_table' folder and simply execute the py files.

## Remarks

Check the charge entries if they are correct. FEAS has different Flight types than the new program.
Ensure that Instruction Flights, Mainenance Flights, etc. are charged to the correct person!
